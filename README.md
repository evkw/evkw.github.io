#Introduction

Living resume application. 

At the moment it is using json files generated from code school and linkedIn. Plan is to have it read files from good reads and any other education resource i can consume.

Good reads was turned off for now due to styling issues, images returned are not good enough quality.

Build with offline first in mind and to be accessible.

Styles using Materialize.css as well as native flexbox.

Angular 2 still does not have a great form validation library.. The Contact form was the best i could do till material design 2 is more complete.

Made using angular 2 seed from https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed
